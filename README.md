# Grant Funds Financial Analysis Project

![logo](




## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the grant funds of a nonprofit organization to evaluate income and expenditures over a 1-year period. The objective is to ensure that donor funds are being allocated and utilized effectively for their intended purposes. We will analyze and classify expenses to identify the largest expenditure categories and provide data-driven insights. Data will be extracted from Sage in CSV format, cleaned and processed in Excel, and loaded into Power BI for modeling and visualization.

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the financial records of grant funds to assess their utilization and ensure transparency. By analyzing income sources and classifying expenses into categories (Project Activity, Administration, Salaries), we will highlight the major areas of spending, helping to inform future budgeting decisions.

---

## Data Sources

Data will be exported from **Sage** accounting software in CSV format, covering:
- **Income**: Donations, grants, and other revenue
- **Expenses**: Detailed records of expenditures over the past year

---

## Data Preparation

### Steps:
- **Export Data**: Extract raw income and expense data from Sage.
- **Excel Organization**: Separate income and expense data into different Excel files.
- **Cleaning**: Clean the data in Excel to ensure it’s ready for analysis.
- **Power BI Import**: Load the cleaned Excel files into Power BI for data modeling and analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before diving into cleaning, we’ll perform an exploratory data analysis to understand the data’s structure and uncover any immediate insights:

1. **Initial Data Review**:  
   - Check for missing or outlier values.  
   - Verify column types (dates, numeric values, categories).

2. **Descriptive Statistics**:  
   - Summarize total income and total expenses.  
   - Calculate average, median, and range for both income and expense records.

3. **Trend Identification**:  
   - Analyze the distribution of expenses over time (monthly, quarterly).  
   - Visualize patterns in income flow from different sources.

4. **Basic Data Visualizations (in Excel or Power BI)**:  
   - **Bar Chart**: Total income vs. total expenses.  
   - **Line Graph**: Time-series analysis of monthly cash flows.  
   - **Pie Chart**: Proportion of expenses in each category (Project Activity, Administration, Salaries).

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

In the cleaning process, we’ll ensure the data is accurate and structured for analysis:

1. **Handling Missing Data**:  
   - Remove or fill in missing values where applicable.  
   - Drop duplicate entries.

2. **Standardizing Fields**:  
   - Ensure consistent date formatting.  
   - Standardize monetary values across income and expenditure records.

3. **Organizing Data into Excel Files**:  
   - Separate files for income and expenses.  
   - Aggregate categories where necessary for simplification.

---

## Income and Expenditure Classification

**Expenses will be classified into three categories**:

1. **Project Activity**: Expenses directly tied to program and project execution.
2. **Administration**: Overhead costs such as office supplies, rent, and utilities.
3. **Salaries**: Compensation for staff, including wages, benefits, and allowances.

This classification will help us assess where the bulk of the funds are being spent, enabling us to provide better insights into the organization's financial health.

## Data Modeling in Power BI

In Power BI, we’ll perform the following steps:

1. **Data Modeling**:
   - Create relationships between income and expense data.
   - Add calculated columns (e.g., total income, total expenses, percentage spent on salaries).

2. **KPI Measurements**:
   - Track the total income received, total expenses, and remaining funds.
   - Measure the percentage of funds allocated to each category (Project Activity, Administration, Salaries).

---

## Mockup Dashboard Design

The dashboard will present an interactive view of the income and expenditure data. Suggested visuals include:

1. **Income vs. Expense Breakdown**:  
   - **Bar Chart**: Comparing total income to total expenditure for the year.

2. **Category Breakdown of Expenses**:  
   - **Donut/Pie Chart**: Visualizing the proportion of funds spent on Project Activity, Administration, and Salaries.

3. **Monthly Cash Flow Analysis**:  
   - **Line Chart**: Displaying monthly income vs. expenses to show trends over time.

4. **Top Expense Categories**:  
   - **Stacked Bar Chart**: Highlighting which category (Project Activity, Administration, or Salaries) had the largest portion of total spending.

5. **Budget vs. Actual Expenditure**:  
   - **Table with Conditional Formatting**: Showing variances between budgeted amounts and actual spending.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

After completing the analysis, the results will provide insights into how donor funds are being utilized. Key findings will include:

- **Conclusions**:  
   - Insights into whether funds were used as intended.  
   - Identification of major expenditure areas and trends.

- **Recommendations**:  
   - Suggestions for optimizing fund allocation to reduce overhead and administrative costs.  
   - Opportunities to improve financial transparency and ensure funds are being used efficiently.

I look forward to providing these final insights after completing the analysis.
